Immersive gaming has never been more portable. Introducing Project Velocity, the world’s first automated triple display laptop. 
Constructed to be incredibly powerful yet mobile, this revolutionary laptop gives you easy access to three eye-popping 4K displays. Regardless of where you are, you can have the visual superiority of a 12K desktop setup to excel at both work and play.
Featuring three stunning high resolution 17.3 inch 4K screens, Project Velocity provides the most expansive viewing experience in a notebook. Powered by an NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1080 GPU, and natively supporting NVIDIA Surround View with a whopping resolution of 11520 x 2160, get a wider view of the race track or the battlefield for an unmatched immersive experience.
The 12K multi-display gives you the expansive workspace and flexibility to tackle any task. Utilize the three displays as one to span your creative projects across the large screen real estate. Alternatively, take advantage of each display independently, running multiple applications simultaneously allowing for multi-tasking like never before.
Without compromising on style or performance, Project Velocity is engineered with an automated deployment system utilizing highly durable aluminum hinges. This allows the two side displays to quickly deploy and lock into place ensuring the perfect alignment in a matter of seconds.
While providing you with three truly stunning displays, Project Velocity stays incredibly portable with a form factor that is comparable to other 17 inch gaming laptops which only provide a single display. The compact chassis fits in your laptop bag so you can have a triple display desktop experience anywhere, anytime.
